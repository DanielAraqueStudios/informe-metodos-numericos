# Copilot Instructions - Academic LaTeX Report Project

## Project Overview
This is an academic LaTeX project for a numerical methods report ("informe-metodos-numericos") targeting IEEE formatting standards. The project emphasizes academic integrity, original content creation, and human-like academic writing.

## Core Architecture
- **Main Document**: `informe.tex` - Primary LaTeX source file (currently empty, needs content)
- **AI Guidelines**: `readme-promt.md` - Comprehensive AI writing instructions for academic content
- **Version Control**: Standard Git setup with `.gitattributes` for text normalization

## Writing Standards & Conventions
Based on `readme-promt.md`, this project requires:

### Academic Writing Requirements
- **IEEE Format**: Strict adherence to IEEE academic paper formatting
- **Original Content**: Human-like technical writing with personal interpretation
- **Natural Flow**: Varied sentence structures, authentic academic voice
- **Proper Citations**: In-text citations and bibliography following IEEE standards

### Content Authenticity Standards
- Write with genuine academic voice demonstrating personal understanding
- Include original examples and interpretations
- Use natural writing flow with logical transitions
- Incorporate authentic technical reasoning with evidence-based conclusions
- Maintain human-like imperfections while preserving academic quality

### AI Detection Evasion Protocols
- Content must exhibit authentic human writing characteristics
- Include natural inconsistencies and stylistic variations
- Use organic thought progression with spontaneous insights
- Apply contextual knowledge gaps and human-like uncertainty expressions
- Maintain natural linguistic patterns mirroring scholarly discourse

## Key Development Workflows

### LaTeX Document Development
1. **Structure**: Follow IEEE paper format (title, abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion)
2. **References**: Include comprehensive bibliography (currently missing per readme instructions)
3. **Figures/Tables**: Add with original captions and explanations
4. **Equations**: Include mathematical expressions relevant to numerical methods

### Content Creation Process
1. Read existing `informe.tex` to understand current state
2. Identify missing sections (especially references as noted in readme)
3. Generate content following the detailed AI guidelines in `readme-promt.md`
4. Ensure IEEE formatting compliance
5. Validate academic integrity standards

## Technical Patterns

### LaTeX Best Practices for this Project
- Use standard IEEE LaTeX document class
- Implement proper sectioning hierarchy
- Include mathematical notation for numerical methods
- Add figures and tables with descriptive captions
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout

### Academic Content Guidelines
- Focus on numerical methods subject matter
- Include technical analysis with personal interpretation
- Use discipline-specific terminology contextually
- Provide evidence-based conclusions
- Demonstrate deep subject comprehension

## Project-Specific Notes
- The `informe.tex` file is currently empty and needs complete content
- Missing references section needs to be added
- Content must pass AI detection tools while maintaining academic credibility
- Project is for "segundo corte" (second assessment) in a numerical methods course
- Target audience: Academic/university level (mechatronics engineering context)

## Critical Considerations
- Always refer to `readme-promt.md` for detailed AI writing guidelines before generating content
- Ensure all generated content follows IEEE academic standards
- Maintain balance between technical accuracy and human-like writing authenticity
- Include proper mathematical notation and methodology explanations for numerical methods topics
